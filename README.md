# School_District_Analysis
Using Python, Anaconda, &amp; Jupyter

# Overview 
The school board has suspected academic dishonesty from 9th graders at Thomas High School. To uphold school testing standards we must go in and remove the math and reading scores for Thomas High School 9th graders while keeping the rest of the data intact. Then perform a new round of anlalysis where we account for the removal of those grades and how it affects:
